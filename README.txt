This is a repository I have created for beginners who are ready to dive into the world of neural networks & machine learning!

I have created a short e-book (in PDF form) that you can download and read through which will get you started coding up your first net. The guide helps you solve the classic MNIST digit classification problem. 

I have also included two source files, each with the code for one of the neural networks described in the PDF. Please download them and refer to them as you read through the e-book. 

Wishing you a good journey on your road to learning about learning!
